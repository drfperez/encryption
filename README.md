# encryption
Complete code for a basic text encryption and decryption program using simple algorithms as Caesar, Vigenere, substitution, XOR ,etc.
AES, Blowfish, triple_DES, Fernet, ChaCha20 algorithms in Python using the cryptography library. The program allows the user to enter the text and the key, select the encryption algorithm from a dropdown menu, and then encrypt or decrypt the text. The program uses PKCS#7 padding to ensure that the input data is padded to a multiple of the block size of the cipher, and CBC mode for both encryption and decryption.
